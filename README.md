# MultisensorX
An Arduino (ESP8266) compatible multisensor harness.

This project requires:
- A WiFi Network (Internet access is not required by default, but you can use a cloud-hosted MQTT broker)
- An MQTT Broker (For example, Mosquitto)
- An ESP8266 with the Arduino Bootloader

## Features

- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor (DallasTemp & I2C) - In development
- DHT11/22 Temperature/Humidity Sensors - In development
- PWM RGB LED Control - In development
- LCD / OLED Display Support - Planned
- MOSFET/RELAY Support (with status) - Planned
